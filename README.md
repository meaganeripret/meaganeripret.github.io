## My Projects


### Women in Engineering at Lehigh University

I, despite not being particularly skilled or interested in the STEM fields, believe that it's important to acknowledge the fact that there aren't nearly as many women as men studying them. I think that it's something that should be encouraged to women because it's easy to feel turned away by a male-dominated field. This is an infographic I created using Canva. 



### How much does Trump care about the Media?
#### Does he trust it?
![Trump infographic](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/President%20Donald%20Trump%20tweeted%20920%20times%20between%20Jan.%2020th%20and%20Jul.%207th%202017.png?raw=true)
Inspired by tonight's State of the Union Address, I created this infographic using Canva to highlight President Trump's obsession with the media and with the idea of "Fake News." In the first 6 months of his presidency, over half of his tweets that mentioned the media said the words "Fake News." That's nuts. 


Here is a timeline of the 2016 Summer Oympics that I created to practice using Timeline
