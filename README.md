# Intro
My name is Meagan Eripret. This is me: ![me](IMG_3518.JPG) ![me](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/fullsizeoutput_2a41.jpeg?raw=true) 

I'm a junior at Lehigh University majoring in English and Journalism and minoring in French. I'm a center on the Women's Basketball team. I love coffee, showtunes, and going through life with [my favorite people](http://www.lehighsports.com/roster.aspx?path=wbball).
Here is my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/meageripret). Feel free to follow me.

This is a story about [me](http://thebrownandwhite.com/2017/12/10/lehigh-womens-basketball-eripret-profile/) that was written by a fellow Lehigh Student-Athlete, Matt Bonshak, in the fall of 2017. I think it gives a good look into how I ended up here. 









## My Projects


### Women in Engineering at Lehigh University
![Canva](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/Engineering%20Majors%20make%20up%2029.8%25%20of%20Lehigh's%20UnderGraduate%20Enrollment.png?raw=true)
I, despite not being particularly skilled or interested in the STEM fields, believe that it's important to acknowledge the fact that there aren't nearly as many women as men studying them. I think that it's something that should be encouraged to women because it's easy to feel turned away by a male-dominated field. This is an infographic I created using Canva. 



### How much does Trump care about the Media?
#### Does he trust it?
![Trump infographic](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/President%20Donald%20Trump%20tweeted%20920%20times%20between%20Jan.%2020th%20and%20Jul.%207th%202017.png?raw=true)
Inspired by tonight's State of the Union Address, I created this infographic using Canva to highlight President Trump's obsession with the media and with the idea of "Fake News." In the first 6 months of his presidency, over half of his tweets that mentioned the media said the words "Fake News." That's nuts. 


### 2016 Summer Olympics

I created this timeline of the 2016 Summer Olympics to practice using Timeline JS


### Ross and Rachel

I created this timeline of one of TV's most iconic relationships using Timeline JS to really nail down exactly how their relationship progressed over the 10 years of the show. There were a lot of ups and downs, but, ultimately, they had their happy ending. 



### Undergraduate Enrollment

#### 2016 Bar Chart
![Chartbuilder Practice](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/2016_Percent_of_Undergraduate_Enrollment%202__chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

I created this chart with Chartbuilder as practice to learn how to use the program. It shows the percentage of undergraduate enrollment at Lehigh University. 

#### 2008-2017 Line Graph
![Line Graph Practice](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/Percent_of_Undergraduate_Enrollment_from_2008-2017_Arts_&_Sciences_Business_Engineering_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

I created this line graph depicting undergrad enrollment from 2008-2017 as more practice using Chartbuilder. 



### The Sixers
![Sixers' Last 10 Seasons](https://github.com/meaganeripret/meaganeripret.github.io/blob/master/Philadelphia_76ers_over_the_past_10_Seasons_Number_of_Wins_Win_Percentage_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)


The Philadelphia 76ers have been a nortoriously mediocre (or even bad) basketball team for the past few years. But luckily for philly sports fans like me, they seem to be on the rise. This chart that compares their number of wins with their win percentage shows that this 2017-2018 season is looking good. They already have as many wins as last year and the win percentage is up by almost 20%! I created this chart with Chartbuilder.

### LUWB Players' High Schools

This is a map created with Google Fusion to show how the athletes of Lehigh Women's Basketball come from all corners of the country. Here's a [link](http://www.lehighsports.com/roster.aspx?path=wbball) to our roster so that you can learn more about all of the players.

I created this map of baby names in the U.S. to pratice using Tableau as a way to organize and present data sets.

These are visualizations of a dataset from Kaggle.com of information on Spotify's top 100 songs of 2017. The first is the distribution by key to see which keys lead to song popularity. The 12 keys were classified by numbers 0-11 with 0 being the key of C and increasing by a half step each time (1=C#, 2=D, etc). The second shows which artists made up the top 100 and how many songs each artist had in the top 100. I created these visualizations with Tableau.
