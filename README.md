I, despite not being particularly skilled or interested in the STEM fields, believe that it's important to acknowledge the fact that there aren't nearly as many women as men studying them. I think that it's something that should be encouraged to women because it's easy to feel turned away by a male-dominated field. This is an infographic I created using Canva.
